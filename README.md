# Korean Terminology

[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/anamba/korean-terms.svg)](https://github.com/anamba/korean-terms/blob/master/LICENSE)

**Current Status: Work In Progress** (give me another week or two to get this thing fully set up)

Specialized terminology and colloquialisms all in one place (and Google-able), to help foreign learners of Korean. Currently U.S. English-heavy, contributions welcome!

The guides in this repository are written for a person who is an intermediate or advanced speaker/writer of Korean, and is already familiar with a given subject area, but is currently unable to discuss it in Korean due to simply not knowing the words Koreans use when discussing this subject.

Where possible, the guides include complete usage examples with real sentences. Sometimes, the hardest part of using new words is knowing which particles to use with them!

Where pronunciation is ambiguous or irregular (often the case when numbers are involved), it is written phonetically in square brackets (e.g. 1사 주자 2루 [일사 주자 이루]).

Notably, this is *not* a resource for absolute beginners, so there should be no romanizations/transliterations, grammar lessons, etc.

## Contributing

Contributions welcome! Each of us is probably well-versed in just a few specific areas, so we all have something to learn from one another.

For Github newbies: Creating a pull request is easy, I promise! Like many things, it's mostly a matter of getting past the unfamiliar terminology. And if you're thinking of contributing, you've clearly done that before, just in a different context. Give it a try! (And don't worry about how many commits you make, all the commits in one pull requests will be "squashed" down to one when merging.)

Follow the existing formatting. For more info, see: [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
